## Instructions


Play the Game:
Select each card by clicking on it. It will be turned face up revealing a symbol. 
Memorize this symbol and the cards placement in the grid.

Each time two (2) cards have been selected these cards will be checked if they match.
    - If they match the cards will remain face up showing the symbol.
    - If they don't match the two cards will be turned face down. 
        - You can select them again to try to match them with other cards in the grid, or just memorize there location and reveal two more.

Star Rating:
At the start of each game you'll have three (3) gold stars. Stars will be removed as the number of moves increases.
Try to find the matching cards in as few moves as possible to save your stars.

Number of Moves:
Each time a card is clicked it will be added to the number of moves displayed above the grid. 

Count Down Timer:
The time is set at three (3) minutes, it will begin to count down to zero when the first card is clicked.
The timer will be stopped when all sixteen (16) matches are found and the total time it took to play that round will be calculated.
It will also stop if the time reaches 0 minutes and 0 seconds. If this happens you can continue playing that round for practice.

Winning the game:
When you have found the matching pairs for all sixteen (16) cards the game is won.
    A pop-up will display total number of moves (cards clicked), total stars awarded, and the time it took to play.
    If you'd like to play again, click the Yes! button to shuffle the cards and reset all the options.
    Otherwise, click the x or anywhere else to dismiss the pop-up.
